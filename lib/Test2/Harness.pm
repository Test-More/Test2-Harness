=head1 NAME

Test2::Harness - Test2 based test harness.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alternative to L<Test::Harness>. See the L<App::Yath> module for
more details.

Try running the C<yath> command inside a perl repository.

    $ yath

For help:

    $ yath --help

=head1 USING THE HARNESS IN YOUR DISTRIBUTION

If you want to have your tests run via Test2::Harness instead of
L<Test::Harness> you need to do two things:

=over 4

=item Move your test files

You need to put any tests that you want to run under Test2::Harness into a
directory other than C<t/>. A good name to pick is C<t2/>, as it will not be
picked up by L<Test::Harness> automatically.

=item Add a test.pl script

You need a script that loads Test2::Harness and tells it to run the tests. You
can find this script in C<examples/test.pl> in this distribution. The example
test.pl is listed here for convenience:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    # Change this to list the directories where tests can be found. This should not
    # include the directory where this file lives.

    my @DIRS = ('./t2');

    # PRELOADS GO HERE
    # Example:
    # use Moose;

    ###########################################
    # Do not change anything below this point #
    ###########################################

    use App::Yath;

    # After fork, Yath will break out of this block so that the test file being run
    # in the new process has as small a stack as possible. It would be awful to
    # have a bunch of Test2::Harness frames on all stack traces.
    T2_DO_FILE: {
        # Add eveything in @INC via -I so that using `perl -Idir this_file` will
        # pass the include dirs on to any tests that decline to accept the preload.
        my $yath = App::Yath->new(args => [(map { "-I$_" } @INC), '--exclude=use_harness', @DIRS, @ARGV]);

        # This is where we turn control over to yath.
        my $exit = $yath->run();
        exit($exit);
    }

    # At this point we are in a child process and need to run a test file specified
    # in this package var.
    my $file = $Test2::Harness::Runner::DO_FILE
        or die "No file to run!";

    # Test files do not always return a true value, so we cannot use require. We
    # also cannot trust $!
    $@ = '';
    do $file;
    die $@ if $@;
    exit 0;

Most (if not all) module installation tools will find C<test.pl> and run it,
using the exit value to determine pass/fail.

B<Note:> Since Test2::Harness does not output the traditional TAP, you cannot
use this example as a .t file in t/.
