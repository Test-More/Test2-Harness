A tiny & dead-simple jQuery plugin for sortable tables. Here's a basic [demo](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/780754/tablesort/index.html).

Maintainers Wanted

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintainers-wanted-red.svg)

I don't use this library much anymore and don't have time to maintain it solo.

If you are interested in helping me maintain this library, please let me know! [**Read more here &raquo;**](https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-tablesort/issues/32)

Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Install
---

Just add jQuery & the tablesort plugin to your page:

```html
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.tablesort.js"></script>
```

(The plugin is also compatible with [Zepto.js](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto)).

It's also available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-tablesort)

`npm install jquery-tablesort`

and [bower](https://bower.io/)

`bower install jquery-tablesort`

Basic use
---

Call the appropriate method on the table you want to make sortable:

```javascript
$('table').tablesort();
```

The table will be sorted when the column headers are clicked.

To prevent a column from being sortable, just add the `no-sort` class:

```html
<th class="no-sort">Photo</th>
```

Your table should follow this general format:

> Note: If you have access to the table markup, it's better to wrap your table rows
in `<thead>` and `<tbody>` elements (see below), resulting in a slightly faster sort.
>
> If you can't use `<thead>`, the plugin will fall back by sorting all `<tr>` rows
that contain a `<td>` element using jQuery's `.has()` method (ie, the header row,
containing `<th>` elements, will remain at the top where it belongs).

```html
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			...
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			...
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

If you want some imageless arrows to indicate the sort, just add this to your CSS:

```css
th.sorted.ascending:after {
	content: "  \2191";
}

th.sorted.descending:after {
	content: " \2193";
}
```

How cells are sorted
---

At the moment cells are naively sorted using string comparison. By default, the `<td>`'s text is used, but you can easily override that by adding a `data-sort-value` attribute to the cell. For example to sort by a date while keeping the cell contents human-friendly, just add the timestamp as the `data-sort-value`:

```html
<td data-sort-value="1331110651437">March 7, 2012</td>
```

This allows you to sort your cells using your own criteria without having to write a custom sort function. It also keeps the plugin lightweight by not having to guess & parse dates.

Defining custom sort functions
---

If you have special requirements (or don't want to clutter your markup like the above example) you can easily hook in your own function that determines the sort value for a given cell.

Custom sort functions are attached to `<th>` elements using `data()` and are used to determine the sort value for all cells in that column:

```javascript
// Sort by dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
$('thead th.date').data('sortBy', function(th, td, tablesort) {
	return new Date(td.text());
});

// Sort hex values, ie: "FF0066":
$('thead th.hex').data('sortBy', function(th, td, tablesort) {
	return parseInt(td.text(), 16);
});

// Sort by an arbitrary object, ie: a Backbone model:
$('thead th.personID').data('sortBy', function(th, td, tablesort) {
	return App.People.get(td.text());
});
```

Sort functions are passed three parameters:

* the `<th>` being sorted on
* the `<td>` for which the current sort value is required
* the `tablesort` instance

Custom comparison functions
---

If you need to implement more advanced sorting logic, you can specify a comparison function with the `compare` setting. The function works the same way as the `compareFunction` accepted by [`Array.prototype.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort):

```javascript
function compare(a, b) {
  if (a < b) {
    return -1;		// `a` is less than `b` by some ordering criterion
  }
  if (a > b) {
    return 1;			// `a` is greater than `b` by the ordering criterion
  }

  return 0;				// `a` is equal to `b`
}
```

Events
---

The following events are triggered on the `<table>` element being sorted, `'tablesort:start'` and `'tablesort:complete'`. The `event` and `tablesort` instance are passed as parameters:

```javascript
$('table').on('tablesort:start', function(event, tablesort) {
	console.log("Starting the sort...");
});

$('table').on('tablesort:complete', function(event, tablesort) {
	console.log("Sort finished!");
});
```

tablesort instances
---

A table's tablesort instance can be retrieved by querying the data object:

```javascript
$('table').tablesort(); 												// Make the table sortable.
var tablesort = $('table').data('tablesort'); 	// Get a reference to it's tablesort instance
```

Properties:

```javascript
tablesort.$table 			// The <table> being sorted.
tablesort.$th					// The <th> currently sorted by (null if unsorted).
tablesort.index				// The column index of tablesort.$th (or null).
tablesort.direction		// The direction of the current sort, either 'asc' or 'desc' (or null if unsorted).
tablesort.settings		// Settings for this instance (see below).
```

Methods:

```javascript
// Sorts by the specified column and, optionally, direction ('asc' or 'desc').
// If direction is omitted, the reverse of the current direction is used.
tablesort.sort(th, direction);

tablesort.destroy();
```

Default Sorting
---

It's possible to apply a default sort on page load using the `.sort()` method described above. Simply grab the tablesort instance and call `.sort()`, padding in the `<th>` element you want to sort by.

Assuming your markup is `<table class="sortable">` and the column to sort by default is `<th class="default-sort">` you would write:

```javascript
$(function() {
    $('table.sortable').tablesort().data('tablesort').sort($("th.default-sort"));
});
```

Settings
---

Here are the supported options and their default values:

```javascript
$.tablesort.defaults = {
	debug: $.tablesort.DEBUG,		// Outputs some basic debug info when true.
	asc: 'sorted ascending',		// CSS classes added to `<th>` elements on sort.
	desc: 'sorted descending',
	compare: function(a, b) {		// Function used to compare values when sorting.
		if (a > b) {
			return 1;
		} else if (a < b) {
			return -1;
		} else {
			return 0;
		}
	}
};
```

You can also change the global debug value which overrides the instance's settings:

```javascript
$.tablesort.DEBUG = false;
```
