        <h2>What is yath?</h2>

        Test2::Harness (cli: yath) is a new test harness intended as an alternative to Test::Harness (cli: prove).
        <p>


        yath introduces new features and a new approach to running your tests.
        <p>


        yath is most useful with large test suites and business/corperate test
        suites, specially ones with long run times.
        <p>

        <h2>What are the benfits</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Preload allows you to run your suite significantly faster</li>
            <li>The event log lets you inspect all the detail of a test run after the fact</li>
            <li>Better output for humans</li>
            <li>New features (like timeouts!)</li>
            <li>Under active development (unlike prove which is mostly just bugfixes at this point)</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Please note, yath is still experimental, and some areas are still under development and expected to change</b>

        <h3>ZipRecruiter</h3>
        At ZipRecruiter the test suite takes over 4 hours to run when using
        prove with -j1. -j2+ is not possible due to multiple factors that would
        require an additional layer to prevent conflicts.
        <p>
        Using yath we can run the test suite in 1.5 hours on the same box using
        a combination of preload and -j3 allowing yath to manage test order and
        handle the conflicts.
        <p>
        Whe are able to further improve this by using a beefy test box with
        -j50 so that the entire thing runs in 15 minutes or less.

        <h3>cPanel</h3>
        yath helps us at cPanel reduce our test suite runtime from ~60 minutes
        to ~12 minutes with a very low effort after a few days of tagging
        tests.
