    - Complete rewrite

0.000013  2017-01-03 21:18:19-08:00 America/Los_Angeles

    - Add event timeout option
    - Fix filename rendering when a test is done
    - Fixed handling of a "plan skip_all" issued in the main test (as opposed
      to a subtest). Partially fixes GitHub
      #21, reported by rjbs.
    - When a test file doesn't run any tests but exits successfully, this was
      treated as a pass. This is now detected and generates different output
      indicating that the process did not run any tests. Fixes the rest of
      GitHub #21, reported by rjbs.

    - Fixed #9, environment now set properly in preload mode
    - Job listeners now receive the Test2::Harness::Job object as the first
      argument, rather than just the job id.
    - Fixed the TAP parser to handle comments with leading
      whitespace. Previously it would strip all the leading whitespace out,
      causing both "# foo" and "#     foo" to be output the same way.
    - Add example for using the harness as a preload test file
    - Document using Test2::Harness as a preload test runner
    - Rewrote all of the internals so that the harness now handles Test2
      events directly, rather than converting them into Test2::Harness::Fact
      objects. The facts were losing some details of the events, and the event
      system already exists and is usable with the harness simply by adding
      some new harness-specific events. Implemented by Dave Rolsky. GitHub
      #20.
